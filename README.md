# Web_Development

Description:
In this repository, I've documented my journey of learning web development by writing code. I've structured the repository into weekly modules, each dedicated to a specific aspect of web development. Starting from foundational concepts such as HTML and CSS, I gradually progressed to more advanced topics like Python programming (with a focus on Django framework), database management (using SQLite3), JavaScript, React library, testing methodologies, continuous integration, and deployment with Docker, scalability, and security considerations.
